# ITIL-v4
Notes for ITIL v4 course I followed on Udemy.

ITIL is a framework for service management.
Service management is a set of organizational capabilities for enabling value to
customers in the form of services.

3rd revolution is about IT, automation and electronic systems.
Then ITIL was created on how to run IT.
It means Information Technology Infrastructure Library.
It contains processes and procedures to better run the IT systems.
Around the world it is defacto solution.

Now we are in 4th revolution. It contains cyber-physical systems.
ITIL is a brand name, and ITIL 4 means the 4th revolution and its acronym no longer
means what it was.

I am a client, food store is the service provider. I got ingredients from there and
then I used those to make a good meal, and that made my belly full and felt good, this is the
value, what the end product gave me, happiness.
Value - The perceived benefits, usefulness and importance of something. So it is subjective.
Value is based on recipient's perception.
Value is co-created by the provider and consumer.

Disconnects are natural, like a customer would want best services and provider want
efficiency, so there could be gaps in the requirements and solutions.

Organization can fulfil 2 generic roles, service provider and consumer.
People can fulfil 3, user, customer and sponsor.
User - Who just uses the services.
Customer - Person who defines the requirements for a service and takes responsibilities for
the outcomes of service consumption.
Sponsor - Authorizes the budget for service consumptions. Also used to describe financial support for
some initiative.

Governance - Means by which an organization is directed and controlled.

Service - Means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating the outcomes the customer wants to achieve,
without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.
Co-creation and outcomes are important terms here.

Product - Configuration of resources created by the organization that will be potentially valuable for
its customers.

Every organization works with resources. These are either owned, belong or managed by the organization.
These resources can be leased or rented (people as well).

Service offering - A description of one or more services designed to address the needs of a target
consumer group.
These can include the followings too: 1) Goods, 2) Access to resources and 3) Service actions.

Goods - Things that are transferred from the service provider to the consumer and then the consumer
is responsible for their future use.

Access to resources - Access to resources are granted or licensed to a consumer under agreed terms and
conditions.

Service action - Actiobs performed to address a consumer's needs.

Service Relationship - A cooperation between a service provider and consumer including service provision,
consumption and service relationship management.

Outcome - A result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs.

Cost - The amount of money spent on a resource or activity.
It maybe measured in man-hours or FTEs.
FTE = 2000 hours of work per year.

If putting more resources gives more value, do it.

Consumers should contribute to reduce the risk.

Risk mitigation is used when we implement technology or processes to reduce the risks.

Utility - Functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need.
Or "what a service/product does". It is referred to as fit for purpose.

Warranty - Assurance that a product or service will meet agreed requirements.
Or "how a service performs". It is concerned with the service's ability to accomplish on what it needs to do.
Referred to as fit for use.

So, if there are 4 people and a car, utility and warranty are both there.
But if there is one more person, then no more place so warranty is still there but no utility, as it is not
fit for the purpose of carrying the people but warranty is there (how it does the service) as it can take
the 4 people well.

A service should have both of the above.

While creating a product or services, consider these 4 factors:
1. Organization and people - Service desk, tiers or flat organization.
2. Information and technology.
3. Partners and suppliers.
4. Value streams and processes - Optimizations.
PESTLE.

Service Value System (SVS) - Describes how all components and activities of the organization works together
as a system to enable value co-creation.
It is made up of 3 parts: Opportunity/demand <> Service value chain <> Value.
Service value chain should have: Guiding principles, governance, practices and continual improvement.

Guiding principle - Guides an organization through all circumstances.
First is focus on value, value from different perspectives.
7 of the guiding principles are:
1. Focus on value.
2. Start where you are.
3. Progress iteratively with feedback.
4. Collaborate and promote visibility.
5. Think and work holistically.
6. Keep it simple and practical.
7. Optimize and automate.

Service value  chain has this:
Plan <> Engage <> Improve <> Products and services. This is not linear, we can do anything first or in any order.

Each activity contributes to the svc chain by transforming inputs into outputs.
SVC uses 34 different combinations of ITIL practices.
All incoming and outgoing interactions are performed through the engage activity.
All new resources are obtained through the obtain/build activity.
Plannig is in plan and improving in improve.

Practice is a set organized resource designed for performing work or accomplishing an
objective.

1. General management practices - 14.
Adapted from wider business domain.
Architecture management, continual improvement, information security, knowledge management, measurement and reporting,
organization change management, portfolio management, project management, relationship management, risk management,
service financial management, strategy management, supplier management and workforce and talent management.

2. Service management practices -  17.
Have been created/adopted from within the service management industry.
Avaiability management, business analysis, capacity performance management, change enablement, incident management,
IT asset management, monitoring and event management, problem management, release management, service catalogue management,
service continuity management, service design, service desk, service level management, service request management and
service validation and testing.

3. Technical management practices - 3.
Technical funtions which have been elevated to the level of a service.
Deployment management, infrastructure and platform management and software development and management.

CI - Any component that needs to be managed to deliver the IT services.

Customer engagement: This involves initial listening, discovery, and information capture on which to base metrics,
measurement, and ongoing progress discussions. Service level management "ensures the organization meets the defined
service levels through the collection, analysis, storage, and reporting of the relevant metrics for the identified
services," not just through customer engagement. The other answer is not correct since it may define the requirements
for service requests but defining the workflow is part of service request management. 

Interactions lead to success.
